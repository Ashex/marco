//! The read contract between marco's structures and its page store.
//!
//! Structures stay synchronous and slice-based. A slice of a paged section
//! comes from [`ReadCx::page`], which either has the page in memory or
//! records it as missing and returns [`Pending`]. One run of a reader's
//! closure is a pass: [`Engine::pass`] pins an epoch guard, runs the closure
//! with a fresh [`ReadCx`] and succeeds only if nothing was missing. A caller
//! that may wait on disk (the miss pool, the writer, checkpoints, admin jobs)
//! calls [`Engine::read_blocking`], which fetches what a pass missed and runs
//! the closure again until a pass comes back clean. A closure may therefore
//! run many times: it must only read, and build its answer from scratch on
//! each run.
//!
//! Every slice is borrowed for `'g`, the life of the guard, so none outlives
//! the pass that read it; the engine reuses a page's frame only once every
//! guard that could have seen it is gone. Passes never wait on I/O while
//! holding a guard.
//!
//! The [`Engine`] lives in [`crate::store::engine`]: it keeps whole files in
//! memory, or reads FORMAT 6 files a page at a time through its cache.
